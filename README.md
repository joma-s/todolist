# todolist
A test to-do list based in CS50W's class

A very simple version of a to-do list in Python, which creates a to-do list per session.
User starts with an empty list and can add new tasks. Once the user starts a new session (e.g. the cookies get cleaned), it starts with an empty tasks list again.
No option to delete tasks yet.
